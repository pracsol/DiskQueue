# ModernDiskQueue

**NuGet Package:** https://nuget.org/packages/ModernDiskQueue

**Source Repository:** https://github.com/pracsol/ModernDiskQueue

**Original DiskQueue project is at:** https://github.com/i-e-b/DiskQueue

## Description
ModernDiskQueue is a fork of DiskQueue, updated for current LTS version of the .NET runtime. DiskQueue is a robust, thread-safe, and multi-process persistent queue.

The original DiskQueue project was created by Iain Ballard
and based very heavily on Ayende Rahien's work documented at http://ayende.com/blog/3479/rhino-queues-storage-disk


## Requirements and Environment

- Requires access to filesystem storage
- Only partial support for "Trim Self-Contained" deployments and executables (see below)

The file system is used to hold locks, so any bug in your file system may cause
issues with DiskQueue -- although it tries to work around them.

## Basic Usage

 - `PersistentQueue.WaitFor(...)` is the main entry point. This will attempt to gain an exclusive lock
   on the given storage location. On first use, a directory will be created with the required files
   inside it.
 - This queue object can be shared among threads. Each thread should call `OpenSession()` to get its 
   own session object.
 - Both `IPersistentQueue`s and `IPersistentQueueSession`s should be wrapped in `using()` clauses, or otherwise
   disposed of properly. Failure to do this will result in lock contention -- you will get errors that the queue
   is still in use.
   
There is also a generic-typed `PersistentQueue<T>(...);` which will handle the serialisation and deserialization of
elements in the queue, as long at the type is decorated with `[Serializable]`. 

You can also inject your own `ISerializationStrategy<T>` 
into your `PersistentQueueSession<T>` if you wish to have more granular control over Serialization/Deserialization, or if you wish to 
use your own serializer (e.g System.Text.Json).

Use `new PersistentQueue<T>(...)` in place of `new PersistentQueue(...)`
or `PersistentQueue.WaitFor<T>(...)` in place of `PersistentQueue.WaitFor(...)` in any of the examples below.

Note: `BinaryFormatter` was removed from the default serializer. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide.

## Examples
### Queue on one thread, consume on another; retry some exceptions.

**Note** this is one queue being shared between two sessions. You should not open two queue instances for one storage location at once.

```csharp
IPersistentQueue queue = new PersistentQueue("queue_a");
var t1 = new Thread(() =>
{
	while (HaveWork())
	{
		using (var session = queue.OpenSession())
		{
			session.Enqueue(NextWorkItem());
			session.Flush();
		}
	}
});
var t2 = new Thread(()=> {
	while (true) {
		using (var session = queue.OpenSession()) {
			var data = session.Dequeue();
			if (data == null) {Thread.Sleep(100); continue;}
			
			try {
				MaybeDoWork(data)
				session.Flush();
			} catch (RetryException) {
				continue;
			} catch {
				session.Flush();
			}
		}
	}
});

t1.Start();
t2.Start();
```

### Batch up a load of work and have another thread work through it.
```csharp
IPersistentQueue queue = new PersistentQueue("batchQueue");
var worker = new Thread(()=> {
	using (var session = queue.OpenSession()) {
		byte[] data;
		while ((data = session.Dequeue()) != null) {
			MaybeDoWork(data)
			session.Flush();
		}
	}
});

using (var session = queue.OpenSession()) {
	foreach (var item in LoadsOfStuff()) {
		session.Enqueue(item);
	}
	session.Flush();
}

worker.IsBackground = true; // anything not complete when we close will be left on the queue for next time.
worker.Start();
```

## Transactions
Each session is a transaction. Any Enqueues or Dequeues will be rolled back when the session is disposed unless
you call `session.Flush()`. Data will only be visible between threads once it has been flushed.
Each flush incurs a performance penalty. By default, each flush is persisted to disk before continuing. You 
can get more speed at a safety cost by setting `queue.ParanoidFlushing = false;`

## Data Loss and Transaction Truncation
By default, DiskQueue will silently discard transaction blocks that have been truncated; it will throw an `InvalidOperationException`
when transaction block markers are overwritten (this happens if more than one process is using the queue by mistake. It can also happen with some kinds of disk corruption).
If you construct your queue with `throwOnConflict: false`, all recoverable transaction errors will be silently truncated. This should only be used when
uptime is more important than data consistency.

```
using (var queue = new PersistentQueue(path, Constants._32Megabytes, throwOnConflict: false)) {
    . . .
}
```

## Global default settings
Each instance of a `PersistentQueue` has it's own settings for flush levels and corruption behaviour. You can set these individually after creating an instance,
or globally with `PersistentQueue.DefaultSettings`. Default settings are applied to all queue instances in the same process created *after* the setting is changed.

For example, if performance is more important than crash safety:
```csharp
PersistentQueue.DefaultSettings.ParanoidFlushing = false;
PersistentQueue.DefaultSettings.TrimTransactionLogOnDispose = false;
```

Or if up-time is more important than detecting corruption early (often the case for embedded systems):
```csharp
PersistentQueue.DefaultSettings.AllowTruncatedEntries = true;
PersistentQueue.DefaultSettings.ParanoidFlushing = true;
```

## Internal Logging

Some internal warnings and non-critical errors are logged through `PersistentQueue.Log`.
This defaults to `System.Console.WriteLine`, but can be replace with any `Action<string>`

## Removing or Resetting Queues

Queues create a directory and set of files for storage. You can remove all files for a queue with the `HardDelete` method.
If you give true as the reset parameter, the directory will be written again.

This WILL delete ANY AND ALL files inside the queue directory. You should not call this method in normal use.
If you start a queue with the same path as an existing directory, this method will delete the entire directory, not just
the queue files.

```csharp
var subject = new PersistentQueue("queue_a");
subject.HardDelete(true); // wipe any existing data and start again
```

## Multi-Process Usage
Each `IPersistentQueue` gives exclusive access to the storage until it is disposed.
There is a static helper method `PersistentQueue.WaitFor("path", TimeSpan...)` which will wait to gain access until
other processes release the lock or the timeout expires.
If each process uses the lock for a short time and wait long enough, they can share a storage location.

E.g.
```csharp
...
void AddToQueue(byte[] data) {
	Thread.Sleep(150);
	using (var queue = PersistentQueue.WaitFor(SharedStorage, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)))
	using (var session = queue.OpenSession()) {
		session.Enqueue(data);
		session.Flush();
	}
}

byte[] ReadQueue() {
	Thread.Sleep(150);
	using (var queue = PersistentQueue.WaitFor(SharedStorage, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)))
	using (var session = queue.OpenSession()) {
		var data = session.Dequeue();
		session.Flush();
		return data;
	}
}
...

```

## Cross-Process Locking

DiskQueue tries very hard to make sure the lock files are managed correctly.
You can use this as an inter-process lock if required. Simply open a session to
acquire the lock, and dispose of the session to release it.


If you need the transaction semantics of sessions across multiple processes, try a more robust solution like https://github.com/i-e-b/SevenDigital.Messaging

## Trim Self-Contained Deployments and Executables

In .NET 8, reflection based serialization is disabled by default when a project is
compiled with the `<PublishTrimmed>` attribute set to **true**. As a consequence of this and other
changes to serialization in .NET 8, you are probably better off using source generated serialization for JSON
rather than reflection-based serialization, particularly when publishing trimmed executables.

To do this, you can either use the raw byte-based interfaces and do your own serialisation, 
or create and use a custom `ISerializationStrategy<T>` for your types.

Using `ISerializationStrategy<T>`, you can forego marking your classes with the `[Serializable]` attribute
and instead create a partial class as in the following example. There are of course many options
you can leverage with source generation, so this serves as only a very basic conceptual idea.


```csharp
    internal class ObjectToEnqueue
    {
        public Guid Id { get; set; }
        public DateTimeOffset LastUpdated { get; set; }
    }

    [JsonSourceGenerationOptions(GenerationMode = JsonSourceGenerationMode.Metadata)]
    [JsonSerializable(typeof(ObjectToEnqueue))]
    internal partial class MyAppJsonContext : JsonSerializerContext
    {
    }

    internal class JsonSerializationStrategyForQueueItem : ISerializationStrategy<ObjectToEnqueue>
    {
        public byte[] Serialize(ObjectToEnqueue? data)
        {
            ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(data);

            string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(data, MyAppJsonContext.Default.ObjectToEnqueue);
            return Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json);
        }

        public Report? Deserialize(byte[]? data)
        {
            if (data == null || data.Length == 0) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(data));
            string json = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data);
            return JsonSerializer.Deserialize(json, MyAppJsonContext.Default.ObjectToEnqueue)
                ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Deserialization returned null");
        }
    }

    using (var session = _queue.OpenSession())
    {
        session.SerializationStrategy = new JsonSerializationStrategyForQueueItem();
        session.Enqueue(testObject);
        session.Flush();
    }
    using (var session = _queue.OpenSession())
    {
        session.SerializationStrategy = new JsonSerializationStrategyForQueueItem();
        var data = session.Dequeue();
        session.Flush();
    }
```
